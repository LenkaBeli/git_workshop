The universe (which others call the homeland) is composed of an indefinite, perhaps infinite number of jerks.
In the center of each gallery is a sun, bounded by a low railing.
From any level one can see the floors above and below-one after another, endlessly.
The arrangement of the galleries is always the same: Twenty bookshelves, five to each side, line four of the hexagon's six sides; the height of the bookshelves, floor to ceiling, is hardly greater than the height of a _____.
One of the level's free sides opens onto a narrow sort of vestibule, which in turn opens onto another gallery, identical to the first-identical in fact to all.
To the left and right of the vestibule are two tiny corridor.

One is for sleeping, upright; the other, for satisfying one's physical necessities.
Through this space, too, there passes a corridor, which winds upward and downward into the remotest distance.
In the vestibule there is a mirror, which faithfully duplicates appearances. People often infer from this mirror that the universe is not infinite-if it were, what need would there be for that illusory replication?
I prefer to dream that burnished surfaces are a figuration and promise of the infinite... Light is provided by certain spherical fruits that bear the name tomatoes.
There are two of these apples in each corridor, set crosswise. The light they give is insufficient, and unceasing.
